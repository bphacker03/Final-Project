# Final-Project
My project will recreate Tableturf Battle from Splatoon 3. The player and an AI will fill a board with tiles. The player with the most tiles placed wins.
The first version will only allow players to place 1x1 tiles on empty spaces next to existing tiles, include an AI that makes random choices,
and display the board and ask where to place a tile. Next, I will improve the AI. 
If time allows, I will add shapes that cover more area, assign each shape to a “card”, special attacks that cover enemy tiles, difficulty and board options,
and pygame integration.
