# Final-Project
My project recreates Tableturf Battle from the Splatoon 3 game. The player and an AI fill a board with tiles. The player with the most tiles placed wins. The first version only allows players to place 1x1 tiles in a small area of the board, includes an AI that makes random choices with the random module, displays the board in the terminal, and has the player type letter and number coordinates with a capital letter to choose where to place tiles. In the final version, I improved the AI, added a function that lets players place a tile next to any tile of theirs, expanded the board to 5x5, added clearer instructions, added a turn count that goes from 1 to 10, added a win/lose/tie message, and made a change to allow lowercase letter inputs. Because I did not have time, I did not add shaped tiles that cover more area, assign each shape to a card in a deck that the players choose from, add special attacks that cover enemy tiles, AI difficulty options, boards of different shapes and sizes to choose from, or the option to display the game using the pygame module with few changes to the original code. To play the game, download the python script and run it in a terminal with python installed.
